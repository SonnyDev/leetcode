        "\n",
        "    - Compare the current element (`nums[i]`) with the element just before the current position of `k` (i.e., `nums[k-1]`).\n",
        "    - If `nums[i]` is different from `nums[k-1]`, it means `nums[i]` is a unique element that we haven't seen before. So, we place `nums[i]` at `nums[k]` and increment `k`.\n",
