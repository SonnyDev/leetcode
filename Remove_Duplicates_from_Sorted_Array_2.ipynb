        "2. Iterate through the array using a pointer i.\n",
        "3. For each element in the array, check if it should be kept based on the following criteria:\n",
        "- If k < 2, it means we are at the beginning of the array, so we keep the element (because we are allowed to have at least two instances of each element).\n",
        "- If nums[i] != nums[k - 2], it means the current element is not a third duplicate, so we should keep it.\n",
        "4. If an element is to be kept, copy it to nums[k] and increment k.\n",
        "5. Continue the process until the end of the array is reached.\n",
